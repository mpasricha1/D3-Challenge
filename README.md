<h1>D3 Challenge</h1> 
<p> The following challenge was to build a scatter plot with a dataset in csv format. The file was read in using D3 and the data 
from several columns were used to build the plot. The plot compaired the percentage of people with healthcare vs the percentage 
of people in poverty. Each State's abbreviation is appended onto the dot in the scatter plot. Also along with the plot, a tool 
tip was created and appended to each state. The tooltip contains the full state and abrreviation, the percentage in poverty and
the percentage with healthcare</p>
